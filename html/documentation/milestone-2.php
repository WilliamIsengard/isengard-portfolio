		<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
			<strong>Who Am I?: </strong>A brief and personable introduction about myself as a full stack web developer and as a person. The images will represent key elements of myself (tentatively my family, CNM Bootcamp, and UNM alumni). The header will include a headshot and personalized background.
			<p></p>
			<strong>What Do I Do?: </strong>This section will include my developer skillset and professional accomplishments. A scrolling gallery will include brand logos of my professional highlights that expand with textual details when clicked (i.e. NM Solar Group image expands to include details on position and achievements). On mobile browsers, the header from the first section will reduce in size and stay static in this and subsequent sections. On full screen browsers, the header will stay static at top of page and the menu buttons will contextually change color when user is on the relevent section of the page.
			<p></p>
			<strong>Can I Help You?: </strong>This section will provide a basic synopsis on how I can help a potential client. It will also include a contact form (simplified on mobile and more detailed on full screen browsers).
			<p></p>
			<strong>How Can I Be Reached?: </strong>The closing section will include ways I can be reached via my professional email address, phone number, LinkedIn page, and GitHub repository.
