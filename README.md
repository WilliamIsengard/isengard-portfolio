## Milestone 1 Feedback
Your Milestone 1 looks awesome! You really captured a realistic and helpful persona for a PWP and did a great job fleshing out all the details. Your goals match the persona and your HTML is SUPER clean. No complaints.

Only suggestion is to watch your .gitignore: You don't need the slash in front of .DS_Store because it's a file, not a directory.

All this and you got it in early, so your Milestone 1 comes in at an easy Tier IV! Great job!!

*Milestone 1: Tier IV*

## Milestone 2a Feedback
Awesome job on your Milestone 2a! I love your content strategy and wireframes and think they're perfectly suited to your purposes. It has lots of cool features without being too much, like clicking the portfolio items for details and your static logo. I love the headings you have for your sections and your focus on what you can do for the user. Your HTML also looks great, you have more indentations than may be necessary and you can use a br tag instead of an empty p tag for line breaks, but overall super great work.

You also got your milestone in early so your Milestone 2a is a Tier IV! Nice job!
