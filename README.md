## Milestone 1 Feedback
Your Milestone 1 looks awesome! You really captured a realistic and helpful persona for a PWP and did a great job fleshing out all the details. Your goals match the persona and your HTML is SUPER clean. No complaints.

Only suggestion is to watch your .gitignore: You don't need the slash in front of .DS_Store because it's a file, not a directory.

All this and you got it in early, so your Milestone 1 comes in at an easy Tier IV! Great job!!
