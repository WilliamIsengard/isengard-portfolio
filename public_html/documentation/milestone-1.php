					<ul>
						<li><strong>Name:</strong> Corvas Brinkerhoff</li>
						<li><strong>Age:</strong> 34 </li>
						<li><strong>Location:</strong> Santa Fe, NM</li>
						<li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Cofounder and SVP of Experience Design at Meow Wolf </li>
						<li><strong>Role:</strong> Primary responsibilities include collaboration and team building with the goal of steering the immersive experiences at Meow Wolf towards dynamic, multimedia-rich, and interactive environments.</li>
						<li><strong>Education:</strong> Columbus College of Art & Design</li>
						<li><strong>Technology:</strong>
							<ul>
								<li><em>Laptop:</em> 15" HP Envy.</li>
								<li><em>OS:</em> Windows 10 Pro.</li>
								<li><em>Browser:</em> Chrome.</li>
								<li><em>Phone:</em> Samsung Galaxy S8. </li>
								<li><em>Mobile Browser:</em> Chrome.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong>Behaviors and Attitude:</strong> Corvas is extremly busy with time-sensitive projects and any free time is spent on moon-shot concepts. He is active in the local and national art and tech communities, but does not social network frequently. He skims resumes and rarely pursues unsolistated applicants and instead focuses on peer recommendations for new hires.</li>
						<li><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> With three new locations in the works around the country, Corvas has an ever-increasing workload and imperative to grow his team with quality professionals. Meow Wolf is a high-profile employeer that generates high volumes of job applicants, but sorting through the masses of resumes is time-consuming and difficult.</li>
						<li><strong>User Story:</strong> As a user, I need to find a skilled, passionate, and self-actualized individual to fill an opening for a junior web developer position.</li>
						<li><strong>Goals:</strong> Corvas is focused on building his team of skilled web developers quickly. The new locations located outside of New Mexico requires talent that can work indepently, but can collaborate with a team spread across multiple geographic locations. Corvas does not have time to scrutinize each application or resume and needs to quickly evaluate a candidate's portfolio easily and efficiently to determine if they are worth reviewing further.</li>
