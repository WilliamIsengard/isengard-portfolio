					<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
						<div class="info">
						  <p>My name is William Isengard and I am a fullstack web developer. After 5 years in technology consulting and corporate account management at HP, Inc. and leading the rapidly-growing solar company NM Solar Group I decided to pursue a life-long goal of learning to program. I attended the intensive web developer bootcamp offered by CNM Ingenuity and built a foundation for my new career.</p>
						  <p>I previously received a Bachelor's of Arts degree (sociology and communication) from UNM and completed 2/3 of an MBA from University of Phoenix before pivoting careers.</p>
						  <p>I am the proud father to an aspiring 4-year old scientist named Leon and married to my best friend Andriana. We are a family of proud geeks and we undertake a variety of adventures during our free time.</p>
